1️⃣ # PIPELINE-PROCESSOR-DESIGN

This Verilog project demonstrates pipeline modeling through a 4-stage arithmetic expression. The design uses registers (latches) to hold intermediate results between stages, improving throughput and allowing multiple operations to be overlapped in time.

2️⃣ Testbench Features:

➡️ Simulates input values with time delays.

➡️ Generates a clock (clk) with 20ns period.

➡️ Outputs monitored using $monitor.

➡️ Waveform generated via $dumpfile and $dumpvars.

Simulation Commands:

▶️ Compile with Icarus Verilog:

▪️iverilog -o pipeline pipeline.v

▶️Run the simulation:

▪️vvp pipeline

▶️View waveform in GTKWave:

▪️gtkwave pipeline.vcd
